  Rotating Flesh Spirals
  ======================
  
  Like [Looping Shape Cereal](https://github.com/quargsgreene/looping-shape-cereal), I once more became inspired by the idea of stim boards and created a three-dimensional version. 
  With just one click of the 'Wee!' button, the user can watch flesh-textured and cone meshes in the shape of fusilli pasta rotate and move around the       scene while also having the capability to click in order to rotate the scene such that one has the choice of multiple different groupings of instruments
  to emphasize within the above song during streaming.
